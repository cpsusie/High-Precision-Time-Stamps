Version 0.1.1.0-beta:
This beta release fixes a major problem with PortableMonotonic stamps being serialized and deserialized on different systems.  Apparently, the min value of DateTime.ToUniversalTime can differ from system to system.  Moreover, it does not seem always to be an offset around the non-daylight savings time utc offset of the current timezone: indeed, I have seen different platforms on the same timezone vary by an odd number of minutes.  I am unsure why this is.  The result was that a portable monotonic stamp serialized on one platform, then deserialized on another would be interpreted differently leading to a discrepancy in the values by sometimes bizarre amounts.  This was resolved by adding a string field to the PortableMonotonic stamp that is set during the OnSerializing callback.  When the stamp is deserialized, the string --if present-- is parsed into a portable monotonic stamp and the internal fields are adjusted accordingly.  If you were only serializing/deserializing these on similar systems in the same timezone, this fix should not affect you.  Going forward, serialized portable stamps will have both the nanoseconds offset field and the stringigied field.  After this beta is tested as used in software I maintain, I will release a non-beta version.

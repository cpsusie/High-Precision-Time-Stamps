This is the non-beta release of the fix introduced with beta version 0.1.1.0-beta.  The issues resolved by that release included problems with serialization and deserialization of portable monotonic stamps when serialized on a system with a different DateTime.MinValue.ToUniversalTime() value than the one on which it is deserialized.  Those changes are discussed in pull request 14 [1], issue 12 [2] and issue 13 [3].  The changes to the code can be reviewed in pull request 14 [1], commit x [5] and, most particularly around these lines of code [6].
